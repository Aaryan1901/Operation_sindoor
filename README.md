## üìä Power BI Intelligence Dashboard

The **Operation Sindoor Overview** dashboard highlights:

- üî• **Total Incidents**: 15,000+ hostile or intercepted events  
- üì° **Jet Trajectory Monitoring**: XY activity of Jet1 vs Jet2  
- ‚úàÔ∏è **Aircraft Coordination Score**: Predicted jet alignment using CNN  
- üß† **Secret Signal Pattern**: Most frequent decoded patterns  
- üìç **Avg Distance Between Jets**: Indicates tactical efficiency  
- üß≠ **Operation Status**: Ratio of Safe vs Escalated missions  
- üì∂ **Signal Filtering**: Dynamic filters for received signal patterns  
- üß© **Embedded ML Outputs**: CNN predictions directly tied to visuals  

Power BI makes it easy for intelligence analysts to interactively explore signal behavior, aircraft movement, and critical metrics during operations.

## üß† Machine Learning Pipeline

### 1. üì• **Data Parsing**
- Raw intercepted signal sequences and aircraft trajectory data are read from a CSV.
- Sequence strings are converted into numerical tensors suitable for training.

### 2. üîß **Model Architecture**
- A **1D CNN** with Batch Normalization, Dropout, and Dense layers.
- Predicts the **XY coordinates** of aircrafts during tactical missions.

### 3. üß™ **Training & Evaluation**
- Model is compiled with **Adam Optimizer** and trained for 100 epochs with early stopping.
- Metrics evaluated:
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
  - **R¬≤ Score**

### 4. üìà **Results**
- The model outputs:
  - Jet 1 & Jet 2 predicted positions
  - Jet Coordination Score based on positional variance
- Test results printed and exported for dashboard integration.
